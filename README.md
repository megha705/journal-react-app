## Introduction

This is an app to create notes 📝.You can also change the header by uploading a picture. ✨
<br>It was built with React, Redux, Firebase, SASS and Jest.
<br>I followed the Udemy course called "React: De cero a experto ( Hooks y MERN )" to do this, then I changed it the way I liked it 💖
